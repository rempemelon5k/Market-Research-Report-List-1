<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Personal Rapid Transit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vehicle Switching</li><li>Track Switching</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) systems can be categorized into two main market types: vehicle switching and track switching. Vehicle switching involves multiple vehicles operating on a fixed track where passengers transfer between pods at designated stations. This allows for flexible routing based on demand. In contrast, track switching enables vehicles to switch tracks autonomously, facilitating direct travel without needing to transfer at stations. Both systems enhance efficiency and adapt to passenger needs, making urban transport more dynamic and responsive.</p></p>
